We are planning to develop an android app that would update attributes of the environment at regular interval. This app will predict any upcoming disaster using machine learning approach in cloud(Azure). This app will also predict the  strength of damage that a disaster can do based on the  data from  previous events. With the help of GPS and other tools, it will indicate whether the place is safe or not, if not suggest nearby safe place(s). It will also contain relevant tips for saving one's life in such disasters.
